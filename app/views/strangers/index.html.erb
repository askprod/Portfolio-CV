										<p class="fw-300">Putting myself up for this photography challenge was easy, but getting to those portraits is a different story. </p>
										<p class="fw-300">I've always had trouble with fear of rejection, and it's surprising how much I have to fight against that fear when I have to go up to complete strangers in the street and ask them: "Can I make your portrait?"</p>
										<p class="fw-300">This project has helped me tremendously in overcoming that unjustified fear: people are surprised that you show some interest in them, they love the interaction, and they ask how they can participate in making the picture a better portrait!</p>
										<p class="fw-300">That does not mean I didn't or won't get any straightforward rejections, but it's teaching me how to deal with them, accept the fact that I can't have any control over what the outcome will be, and that I should not take it personnally.</p>
										<p class="fw-300">Even though some pictures aren't perfect, I find them emotionnally expressive and great as a whole. I think the benefit of the project are not the pictures themselves, but the adventure that they provided.</p>

</p>
										<p class="fw-300">I hope you enjoy this collection, and I want to thank all these strangers for their kindness, their joie de vivre, and wish them the very best for what's to come!</p>
